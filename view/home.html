                        Kanban is a popular Lean workflow management method for defining, managing, and improving 
                        services that deliver knowledge work. It helps you visualize work, maximize efficiency, 
                        and improve continuously. Work is represented on Kanban boards, allowing you to optimize work delivery 
                        across multiple teams and handle even the most complex projects in a single environment.

                        At the beginning of the 21st Century, key players in the software industry quickly realized how Kanban could positively change the way products and services were delivered.
                        With an increased focus on efficiency and by harnessing advances in computing technology, Kanban left the automotive industry's realm and was successfully applied to other complex commercial sectors such as IT, software development, R&D, and others.
                        Indeed, what we now recognize as the Kanban Method emerged at the beginning of 2007. It is a result of years of testing, experience, and joint efforts of leading figures in the Lean and Agile community, such as David Anderson, Dan Vacanti, Darren Davis, Corey Ladas, Dominica DeGrandis, Rick Garber, and others.
                        You can start building your Kanban system by setting up the most straightforward Kanban board with three basic columns – “Requested”, “In Progress” and “Done”. When constructed, managed, and functioning correctly, it serves as a real-time information repository, highlighting bottlenecks within the system and
                        anything else that might interrupt smooth working practices.

                        The most important difference between Kanban and Scrum is that the former 
                        is a method, while the latter is a framework. Kanban builds a continuous delivery 
                        model where teams release value as soon as they are ready, while Scrum organizes work in Sprints. 
                        Applying either one depends on the nature of your process, however, it can be said that Kanban offers a 
                        more tailor-made approach while Scrum relies on predetermined rules. Another key distinguishing characteristic 
                        between the two is the mindset and founding belief systems of Scrum and Kanban.

                        For a successful Kanban implementation, the method relies on six essential practices:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Visualizing the workflow: Creating a visual representation of the workflow helps to identify bottlenecks, visualize the flow of work, and make the work more transparent.                    
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Limiting work in progress: Limiting the amount of work in progress helps to prevent multitasking and improve focus on completing one task at a time, thereby improving efficiency and reducing lead time.                    
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Managing flow: Kanban aims to help in optimizing flow which can be achieved by monitoring flow metrics, identifying and addressing bottlenecks, and continuously improving the workflow.                    
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Making process policies explicit: Defining and communicating process policies clearly helps to ensure that everyone understands how work is supposed to be done, which reduces misunderstandings and promotes consistency                   
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implementing feedback loops: Kanban emphasizes the importance of getting feedback from customers, stakeholders, and team members as a way to identify areas for improvement.                    
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Improving collaboratively: Kanban is a continuous improvement process that encourages collaboration and experimentation to identify and solve problems, improve continuously, and evolve their processes to better meet the needs of their customers.                    
                            </li>
                        </ul>                    
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item">

                        The Kanban method is based on six foundational change management and service delivery.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Start with what you do now: Kanban is about continuous improvement, but it starts with an understanding of the current processes and workflows.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change: Rather than attempting a large-scale transformation all at once, Kanban advocates for small, incremental changes that build on each other over time.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Encourage acts of leadership at all levels: Kanban is not just for managers or team leads but for everyone involved in the work. Anyone can take leadership and suggest improvements based on their observations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Focus on customer needs and expectations: Kanban promotes understanding the needs and expectations of your customers to elevate the quality of the provided services and the value it creates.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Manage the work, not the workers: Kanban respects the existing roles and responsibilities of team members and empowers people’s abilities to self-organize around the work.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Regularly review the network of services: Kanban encourages collaboration and encourages team members to share their observations, ideas, and feedback for improving the work through regular reviews of the entire network of services.
                            </li>
